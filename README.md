# LaTeX templates

Basic templates for my various $\LaTeX$ needs. All organised in the file `latex-templates.org`, which, when saved, [tangles](https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html) a number of template files to the `templates` directory. This approach is inspired by (and in part shamelessly copied from) Timm Lichte's rather more sophisticated implementation (<https://rubygems.pkg.github.com/timmli/latex-templates>).


Currently in use:
- `plain` (narrow margins, Times font)
- `article` (wide margins, Palatino font)
- `lecture` (relatively plain, used for teaching)
- `conference-presentation` (based on the [Metropolis](https://github.com/matze/mtheme) theme, modified with some [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/docs/colors-and-palettes) palette choices)
- `tufte-handout` (an experiment with handouts based on the style of Edward Tufte, using the [tufte-latex](https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/) classes) 

Still to be converted:
- `handout` (used for my lectures at Oxford; has some nice boxes I implemented for exercises/extra info)
- `oxford/oslo-presentation` (hand-made minimialist Beamer setup. Probably can just be superseded by my Metropolis-based setup)
