# LaTeX templates

Basic templates for my various LaTeX needs. To be used along with the Bash scripts in the [scripts](https://github.com/findlayjy/scripts) repository.

Inspired by (and shamelessly copied from) Timm Lichte's much more sophisticated implementation (<https://rubygems.pkg.github.com/timmli/latex-templates>).
